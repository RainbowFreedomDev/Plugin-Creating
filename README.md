# Plugin Creating #

>These are the requirements for creating a plugin for RainbowFreedomDev members. If you are going to create a plugin for RainbowFreedom, you must:

1) Put the main file under "com.RainbowFreedomDev.(Plugin Name).(Main or Plugin Name)"

2) Contact [FoxIshDaBest] (https://github.com/FoxIshDaBest) and tell him what the plugin does, why you think it should be added to RainbowFreedom, and who will develop it.

3) Have a lot of experience with developing plugins. We do not want bad quality code.

4) Make sure your plugin was tested and works. This means you have to test it before uploading it to the [RainbowFreedomDev Organization] (https://github.com/RainbowFreedomDev).

After you make your plugin (*that meets all of the requirements*), send [FoxIshDaBest] (https://github.com/FoxIshDaBest) an email at foxishdabest@gmail.com
